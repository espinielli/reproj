\title{Reproject data from source to target coordinate system.}
\description{
reproj provides helpers for easily reprojecting generic data, by depending
only on a reprojection engine (proj4 for now).
}
\details{
The function `reproj` is designed to take an input data set `x` and then a
`target` coordinate system specification. The `source` argument is not positional
(must be named) and must be provided. 
Currently the coordinate system may be a 'PROJ string' or 'EPSG code' either 
as  a number or text.

Methods are provided for data frame and matrix, add S3 methods for
you classes in your own package. For classed objects, or objects with a known
method for finding the 'source' coordinate system your method can provide 
that logic.
}
